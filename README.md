## Water Resources Modeling Library
This library provides a comprehensive suite of tools for simulating and analyzing water resources. It is designed to support a wide range of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling applications, including:

## Key Features
- Hydrologic Processes: Simulate processes such as precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, infiltration, runoff, and groundwater flow.
- Hydraulic Modeling: Analyze river and stream flow, reservoir operations, and floodplain mapping.
- Data Integration: Seamlessly integrate with various data sources, including weather data, land use data, and remote sensing data.
- Modular Design: The libraryâ€™s modular architecture allows users to easily extend and customize functionalities to meet specific project needs.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for setting up models, running simulations, and visualizing results.
- Flexible and Scalable: Suitable for small-scale watershed studies to large-scale regional water resource assessments.
- Open Source: Fully open-source, encouraging community contributions and collaboration.
- Advanced Analytics: Includes tools for statistical analysis, machine learning integration, and scenario planning.
- Documentation and Examples: Comprehensive documentation and example projects to help users get started quickly.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
