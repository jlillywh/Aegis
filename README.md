This is a library for simulating water resources systems. Components in this library (if used by themselves) operate at a single point in time. Objects used in the simulator will update using the clock and produce time series results to show how the state of the system changes over time.

The classes in this library:
- Source
- Sink
- Storage
- Flow
- Network
- Simulation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
